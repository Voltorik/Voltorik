## Hello there, I'm a software engineer focused on backend systems, internal tooling, and automation. 

## What I do
I primarily work in Python and JavaScript building reliable and performance-oriented tooling, with experience refactoring and maintaining long-lived internal systems in enterprise environments.

Languages I use the most:
- **Python**
- **JavaScript (NodeJS)**

Languages I've experimented with:
- Java
- C++

## Here's a few things I've made:
- [Personal Site backend proxy](https://github.com/Voltorik/Volt_blogSite_backend) - Backend proxy hosted via Render to safely deliver RSS data to the client under browser security constraints.
- [Twitter Post to Markdown Convertor](https://github.com/Voltorik/TwitterPostToMarkdown_Convertor) - Utility to extract structured content from dynamically rendered Twitter pages and persist it as Markdown using Selenium.
- [Personal Website](https://github.com/Voltorik/voltorik.github.io) - Continuously iterative centralized personal repository of my interests, projects, thoughts, and ideas. 
- [Minecraft world save mover script](https://github.com/Voltorik/minecraft_WorldSave_Mover) - File synchronization utility to support local iteration against live multiplayer server state.

## Current areas of focus:
- Backend and API design
- Testing frameworks for unit and performance testing
- Systems-level thinking

## Future endeavours:
Future topics I'd like to explore include systems engineering, embedded systems, robotics, and game engines.
