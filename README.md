## Hey there! I'm a SWE focused on backend developemnt and automtion. 
_(The SWE bit is kinda obvious huh haha)_
Currently building skills in backend development, automation, and lightweight web tooling.

## What I do
I work primarily with Python and JavaScript building backend services, automation tooling, and internal applications.

Languages I use the most:
- Python
- JavaScript (NodeJS)

Languages I've experimented with:
- Java
- C++

## Here's a few things I've made:
- [Personal Site backend proxy](https://github.com/Voltorik/Volt_blogSite_backend) - I needed a way to call my substack RSS feed with CORS for displaying on my site, so I built a small backend proxy that I hosted on Render as an intermediatary point.
- [Twitter Post to Markdown Convertor](https://github.com/Voltorik/TwitterPostToMarkdown_Convertor) - Wanted an easy way to locally save a post from Twitter (X), so I built a little script that leverages Selenium to scrape the post text and convert it to a .md file. (Results may vary if the parsing format was updated on Twitter's side)
- [Personal Website](https://github.com/Voltorik/voltorik.github.io) - Personal website I am regularly iterating on. Longterm goal is for it to be a centralized repository of all my interests, projects, thoughts, ideas, or otherwise.
- [Minecraft world save mover script](https://github.com/Voltorik/minecraft_WorldSave_Mover) - I wanted to be able to copy a minecraft world from a server I was hosting to my local minecraft instance so they were synced and I could mess with a currently updated version of the world without needing to boot up the server. It's a small script, but it was very useful for the specfic issue I had. 

## What I'm learning:
- Backend and API design
- Testing frameworks for unit and performance testing
- Systems-level thinking
- Working on Portfolio projects

## Projects in progress:
- Job tracker API: Wanting to build a small tool for myself to systematically track, update, and plot job applications
- Personal website (WIP and have more plans to fully develop this)

## Future endeavours:
Future interests include systems engineering, robotics, and embedded systems..... assuming I keep building things instead of overthinking them lol
